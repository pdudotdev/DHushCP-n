## üîç Overview

**DHushCP** is a Linux tool designed to facilitate **secure covert wireless communication** between two parties - an Initiator and a Responder - using standard **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** packets. 

**DHushCP-n** is a Linux-based, secure communication tool built on top of **DHushCP**. This version introduces **nested text steganography**, enhancing **DHushCP**'s capabilities by embedding covert messages within cover texts using zero-width characters.

Read all about **DHushCP**'s features [**HERE**](https://github.com/0SINTr/DHushCP?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-dhushcp-covert-communication-via-dhcp-%EF%B8%8F).

üçÄ **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **research project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

## üöÄ DHushCP-n vs. DHushCP

The original **DHushCP** secures the key and message exchange between the **Initiator** and the **Responder** by embedding the encrypted message in Option 226 of DHCP Discover packets.

### Benefits

With the original **DHushCP**, following the ECC-based key exchange the **plaintext message** entered by the user is:
- Encrypted using the shared **AES** key with **AES-GCM** with a **SHA-256** checksum appended
- Obfuscated using **Network Steganography** principles inside **DHCP Option 226**

***NEW!*** Now **DHushCP-n** adds yet another layer of obfuscation by using **Text Steganography**.<br /><br />
Therefore, with **DHushCP-n** the **plaintext message** entered by the user is:
- Embeded into a predefined 8-character `cover_text` string using zero-width characters
- Encrypted using the shared **AES** key with **AES-GCM** with a **SHA-256** checksum appended
- Obfuscated using **Network Steganography** principles inside **DHCP Option 226**

### Limitations 

Unlike the original **DHushCP**, the **DHushCP-n** version comes with some limitations:
- **Limited Per-Packet Capacity:** With an 8-character cover text, only 15 characters (secret message) can be embedded per DHCP Discover packet. Transmitting longer messages requires sending multiple packets, which may be noticeable under certain network conditions.
- **Potential Stripping by Systems:** Some systems, applications, or network devices might inadvertently strip or alter zero-width characters, disrupting message integrity or making embedded messages inaccessible.

## üîÑ Communication Flow

1. **Initial Exchange:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Generates a unique session ID.
     - Detects and selects the active wireless interface.
     - Generates an ECC key pair (private/public keys).
     - Embeds its public key, the DHUSHCP_ID (option 224), and session ID (option 225) into the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet and waits for the Responder's public key.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Listens for DHCP Discover packets with option 224 set to DHUSHCP_ID.
     - Upon receiving a valid DHCP Discover (option 224 set to DHUSHCP_ID), extracts the session ID from option 225.
     - Extracts and reassembles the Initiator's public ECC key from the correct DHCP option.
     - Generates its own ECC key pair.
     - Embeds its public key, the DHUSHCP_ID, and the extracted session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover and waits for Initiator's message.

2. **Message Transmission:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the Responder's public key from the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Derives the shared AES key using its private ECC key and the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Prompts the user to input a message to send to the Responder.
     - **Embeds the secret message into an 8-character cover_text using zero-width characters.**
     - Encrypts the **stego message** using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and adds a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet from the Initiator.
     - Extracts and decrypts the message using the shared AES key.
     - **Decodes the stego message to retrieve the original secret message.**
     - Displays the decrypted message to the Responder user.
     - Prompts the Responder user to input a reply message.
     - **Embeds the secret message into an 8-character cover_text using zero-width characters.**
     - Encrypts the reply using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted reply.

3. **Finalization:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet containing the Responder's reply.
     - Decrypts the reply using the shared AES key.
     - **Decodes the stego message to retrieve the original secret message.**
     - Displays the decrypted reply message to the Initiator user.
     - Upon request (`Ctrl+C`), performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs (syslog, auth), and resetting the terminal.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Upon request (`Ctrl+C`), performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs (syslog, auth), and resetting the terminal.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali)
  - Latest release thoroughly tested and functional on **Ubuntu 24.04**.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies:**
  - `scapy` for packet crafting and sniffing
  - `cryptography` for ECC encryption and checksum generation
- **Privileges:** Root or sudo access to send and receive DHCP packets
- **Network Interface:** Active wireless interface in UP state

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the commands below in your Linux terminal.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0SINTr/DHushCP-n.git
   cd DHushCP
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required Python packages.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-scapy
   sudo apt install python3-cryptography
   ```

3. **Configure Wireless Interface:** Ensure that your wireless interface is active and in the UP state. **DHushCP** will automatically detect and prompt you to select the active interface if multiple are detected.

4. **Run the Scripts:** Both Initiator and Responder scripts require root privileges to send and sniff DHCP packets. You can run the scripts using `sudo`:

**Responder:**
```
   set +o history
   sudo python3 responder.py --id DHUSHCP_ID
```

**Initiator:**
```
   set +o history
   sudo python3 initiator.py --id DHUSHCP_ID
```

Follow the on-screen prompts on the **Initiator** to initiate and manage the communication session. Make sure the **Responder** is already listening.

## üéØ Planned Upgrades
- [x] Improved CLI experience
- [ ] DER encoding vs. PEM now
- [ ] More testing is needed
